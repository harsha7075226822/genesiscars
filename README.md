# ProjectGenesis React

This is a minimal React port of your existing HTML/CSS page.

- UI and structure are preserved.
- Your original styles were copied into `src/projectgenesis.css` and imported in `App.jsx`.
- Bootstrap 4, jQuery, and Popper are included via CDN in `index.html` to keep the carousel and navbar toggler working as-is.

## Run locally

1. Install deps (Node 18+ recommended):

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the printed local URL.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
